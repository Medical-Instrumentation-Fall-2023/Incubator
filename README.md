# Infant Incubator Using Arduino
![Infant Incubator](Image/Incubator.jpeg)

## Overview

This project is an Infant Incubator designed to maintain a stable environment for newborns. It includes features such as temperature and humidity monitoring, door open detection, and jaundice detection. The incubator uses an Arduino to control various sensors and actuators, ensuring the infant's safety and comfort.

## Features

- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Two DHT11 sensors measure temperature and humidity at different points, providing an average reading for accurate control.
- **Door Open Detection**: An ultrasonic sensor detects if the incubator door is open and triggers an alarm.
- **Heating System**: A relay-controlled 100-watt incandescent bulb acts as a heater to maintain the desired temperature. **Note**: Due to budget constraints, we utilized a 100-watt incandescent bulb as a heating element. In a real-world application, this should be replaced with a proper medical-grade heater to ensure optimal performance and safety.
- **Jaundice Detection**: A color sensor (TCS3200) detects jaundice by measuring the baby's skin color.
- **Alarms**: Two buzzers provide audible alerts for different conditions (door open and low temperature).
